# Force2017 Software Citation Implementation Working Group

Sign up and obtain more information on the [Home Page](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group).
The group is open to everyone who wants to help promote the implementation of
the Force11 [software citation principles](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86).
All active group members are listed [here](https://www.force11.org/group/7784/members).
The mailing list for group members is [softwarecitationimplementationwg@force11.org]( softwarecitationimplementationwg@force11.org).

Use the group [GitHub repository](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg) for
documentation and discussion.

The group started in May 2017 and will wrap up work in December 2018.

## Description

This group builds on the previous [Software Citation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group), 
which developed and publicized an initial set of software citation principles ([https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86)).

The activities of the Software Citation Implementation Working Group will be conducted with
relevant stakeholders (publishers, librarians, archivists, funders, repository developers,
other community forums with related working groups, etc.) to:

1. endorse the principles
2. develop sets of guidelines for implementing the principles
3. help implement the principles
4. test specific implementations of the principles. 

During this process, the principles may also be updated based on feedback from the activities.

## Co-Chairs

- [Neil Chue Hong](https://github.com/npch)
- [Martin Fenner](https://github.com/mfenner)

## Virtual and In-person Meetings

We will kick-off the project via two staggered telcons, where the co-chairs will introduce draft plans and get feedback
on the scope of work. The kick-off telcons will be held at:

- 2nd June 2017 at 07:00 CDT / 08:00 EDT / 12:00 UTC / 13:00 BST / 14:00 CEST / 15:00 EEST / 22:00 AEST
- 6th June 2017 at 07:00 PDT / 08:00 MDT / 09:00 CDT / 10:00 EDT / 14:00 UTC / 15:00 BST / 16:00 CEST / 17:00 EEST / 00:00+1 AEST

After the initial telcons, the group will meet monthly at a dedicated time.

We will organize in-person workshops either co-located with other events, or where
we have obtained funding to organize workshops. These in-person workshops will
focus on specific topics, e.g. handling software citations in publishers systems.

In addition we will try to organize sessions in appropriate conferences, e.g.
[WSSSPE5](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/) (September 2017 Manchester and
October 2017 Auckland) and [Force2017](https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2017)
(October 2017 Berlin). The goal of these sessions is to inform the wider community
about the work of the group, and to collect feedback.

## Timeline

- **Launch**. Identify communities to reach out to and engage as early adopters.
  Have all relevant stakeholders join the working group. Agree on scope,
  high-level goals, and how the group operates.
- **Architecture**. Resolve relevant architecture issues, via in-person workshop
  for more complex issues.
- **Pilot Implementations**. Build and launch pilot implementations.
- **Evaluation**. Describe the work we have done and the lessions learned in a paper.

We will use these as milestones in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues), and link issues accordingly.

## What we need

- reference managers support
- citation styles support (most citation styles don't handle software specifically,
  Citeproc doesn't have type software/computer program)
- publisher support (ensure software references are not stripped, make them
  machine readable/discoverable)
- reference implementations for software versioning
- file with citation metadata in bibtex or json format (e.g. codemeta) in code repository root

  applying principles from this working group and serving as an example implementation of a citable code archive.
 

## Potential early adopter groups

What are the early adopter groups who could be persuaded to write papers following software citation principles and using software citation tools?

- astronomy
- math
- geosciences
- structural biology
- neuroimaging
- [ACAT workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/567550/) - tools for applied physics, badge if they cite software
