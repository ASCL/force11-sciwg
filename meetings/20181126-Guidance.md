## Agenda

1. Meeting times

Would like to set up two regular meeting times, to encompass people in Australasia as well as California.

Suggest:
- 16:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC on third Wednesday of the month, but looking for others to help co-chair so open to suggestions

Aim of future meetings will be working calls, to focus on writing / reviewing a specific piece of guidance each month.

2. Scope of group

Produce guidance for different stakeholders to interpret and implement the Software Citation Principles.

Which stakeholders should we target first? E.g.
- Journal Editors
- Journal Publishers
- Researchers submitting to journals
- Researchers publishing software
- Institutional research data managers
- Funders

Who is seeking guidance, and who might have the most influence on changing practices, if guidance was to be provided?

3. Format of guidance

For the chosen stakeholer group, what should the guidance cover, what examples would be most useful, and what format is appropriate?
