## Agenda and Notes

### Update on RDA Plenary Melbourne / FAIR Software WG 

- Agreement from FORCE11 to have this as a joint RDA/ReSA/FORCE11 working group
- This would mean that documents / guidance would be jointly badged, and that there would be alignment over the WG chairs and calls. Aim is to ensure that we don't end up with multiple groups, one per organisation, discussion this topic with overlapping memberships.
- Session at RDA P15 in Melbourne will be in Session 2, Day 1 - programme is now online. Noted that it clashes with a number of other FAIR sessions.

### Update from task forces

- Guidance Task Force
   - No meeting in January
   - Neil pointed to the new "slimmed down" guidance aimed at people new to software: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/blob/master/guidance/software_citation_primer.md

- Journals Task Force
   - We have a number of publisher representatives on board, and Shelley is identifying professional society contacts
   - Suggestion from Morane to also get artefact evaluation committee chairs involved
 
- Repositories Task Force
   - No meeting in January
   - Putting out Best Practices for repositories as a draft to encourage more people to join
   - Tom Pollard (BioPhysioNet) interested in attending call 
 
- Codemeta task force 
   - Aligning codemeta vocabulary with schema.org
   - Workflow that task force is following, adding terms to SoftwareSourceCode or Software Application class
   - Link to the working document: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues/95 https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues/232 

### AOB

- Peter mentioned that GRASS GIS have started putting projects on GitHub (see: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2020-January/094050.html - NB: not sure if this was the correct link)

- Discussion of ideas for these calls
	  - If we have these as more community calls, with some time devoted to presentations, it might encourage additional engagements, particularly if topics are advertised ahead of time.
	  - 1-2 people to help line up presentations for the calls
   - Possible topics: 
      - Present the works of the task forces at a "higher" level
      - New CFF schema
      - FAIR for software
      - Measuring uptake
	  -  Neil to check with Dan and Martin how to take this forward, advertise for suggestions
