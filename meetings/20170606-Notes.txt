From Daniel S. Katz to Everyone: (02:59 pm)
We'll start in a minute or two
From Me to Everyone: (02:59 pm)
Hi All, we’ll get started in a few minutes as we wait for people to join.
We’ll be discussing the things that are in the github repo here: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg

We’ll go in this order:
Allen Lee Ashley Sands Fernando Rios Jessica Hausman Jonathan Sick Robert Haines  Person from eLife Person on Phone
From Me to Everyone: (03:11 pm)
Allen Lee: built digital repo for archaeology. Now working for network for Computational Modelling for Economic and Social Services. Interested in implementing principles.
From Me to Everyone: (03:11 pm)
Ashley Sands: researcher at UCLA, looking at astronomers and how they understand data. And how data and software are intertwined.
From Daniel S. Katz to Me: (Privately) (03:12 pm)
the eLife person looks like Naomi
From Allen Lee to Everyone: (03:12 pm)
Relevant links / community from our end: www.comses.net and www.openabm.org
From Me to Everyone: (03:12 pm)
Fernando Rios: rJHU research data management services group. Looking at supporting software in context of data management, preservation, archiving. Part of previous Software Citation WG. How to provide advice to researchers on citing software and making software citable.
Jessica Hausman: Center for Physical Oceanography at NASA. Chair Software Citation group in ? (sorry didn’t catch that)
From Me to Everyone: (03:14 pm)
Jonathan Sick: LSST. Making sure all the software they’re producing is citable.
From Jessica Hausman to Everyone: ((null))
I’m at PO.DAAC and chair the ESDSWG software and services citations working group under ESDIS. It’s NASA and we like our alphabet soup.
From Me to Everyone: (03:17 pm)
Rob Haines: lead RSE group at Uni Manchester. Interested in credit for software. RSE’s generally might be good early adopters
(thanks Jessica)
Melissa Harrison. eLife. Involved in FORE11 Data Citation group. Chair of JATS4R. Make sure synergy with this work.
From Martin Fenner to Everyone: (03:19 pm)
Github issue regarding JATS: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues/7
From Me to Everyone: (03:19 pm)
http://jats4r.org/about-jats4r
From Me to Everyone: (03:20 pm)
Melissa could share/link initial recommendations.
Martin Fenner: Datacite. How can DOIs help with software citation.
From eLife to Everyone: (03:21 pm)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zztrTpTHtcdS5093j9UzIHHjgQS7-EzF2uF_WzeV9G8/edit#heading=h.eeew73cotjfj
also added to the Github issue
From Me to Everyone: (03:22 pm)
Neil Chue Hong: Software Sustainability Institute. Update our guidance on software citation for our community, understand how much software is out there.
From Me to Everyone: (03:23 pm)
Dan Katz: previously funder, software citation would be useful to know what software is out there, help understand what to fund.
Melissa: manage versioning when citing
Robert: software that uses other software - bubbling citations through (like Depsy.org)?
From Robert Haines to Everyone: (03:29 pm)
https://libraries.io/
From Me to Everyone: (03:31 pm)
For software, there is other information (dependency lists, package lists) that can augment the information from software citation. Ensure that software citation does not break this use case. Understand if any of the information that is captured today outside software citations might be able to be captured in a software citation.
From Allen Lee to Everyone: (03:33 pm)
We're building a code library for computational models that bundles all software & data dependencies for a given computational pipeline in a Docker image  - this is the next generation of our existing model library (www.openabm.org/models) that we are building at github.com/comses/core.comses.net
From Me to Everyone: (03:34 pm)
Martin: DataCite Metadata WG - next meeting focusses on software citation. Feedback: how can we coordinate. Should we have a joint call, share documentation for feedback? Versioning is one example of something covered there.
From Me to Everyone: (03:35 pm)
Interested in computing some information automatically from repository directly e.g. author information. Template CodeMeta.
(previous comment was from Jonathan Sick)
From Martin Fenner to Everyone: (03:37 pm)
Mapping authors to committers: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues/8
From Martin Fenner to Everyone: (03:40 pm)
Citing for credit vs. credit for specificity: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues/11
From Me to Everyone: (03:44 pm)
here’s some previous work that’s been done on the issue of persistently identifying software with some discussion of versions and dependencies done by STFC and St Andrews: http://rrr.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/guidelines-software-identification.pdf
From Daniel S. Katz to Everyone: (03:47 pm)
COPE - https://publicationethics.org  could consider software as well
From Me to Everyone: (03:49 pm)
Reproducibility issues if people publishing based on forks rather than main branch.
Robert: software that uses other software - bubbling citations through (like Depsy.org)?
