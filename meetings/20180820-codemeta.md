### Call logistics

 - Call schedule needs to be decided.
 - Notes will be published at: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/tree/master/meetings
 - Participants can raise things that they are working on / want to bring peoples attention to by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues). The co-chairs will curate and tag these issues as required, and maintain a document linking to them to summarise current status.
