## Agenda and Notes

- report from Repositories workshop (Alice). Workshop info at https://github.com/ASCLnet/SWRegistryWorkshop . Good enough software citation workflow. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAuZcZiOMS7iddhdzphmKhs3vZTcbe2Bicz_cUT7CGs/edit?usp=sharing. Value statement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJbmpR1HbAAKB5YLaGYHcaFIwN3IGGayyPGCKeQIxCU/edit?usp=sharing. More work is needed aligning codemeta and CFF metadata formats. Proposal: Codemeta as the exchange of metadata between repositories, and CFF should be translatable to codemeta when authors use it. Repositories Task Force will soon wrap its work on best practices. People from workshop want to continue to meet.
- update on RDA Plenary Melbourne (Dan). Submissions for session proposal Software Source Identification WG and Software Source Code IG. The first session if about use cases, the second about FAIR for software.
- update from Codemeta task force (Martin). Task Force started to work on codemeta properties not yet defined by schema.org. The 10 properties to work on are listed in the following document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VmUBdgaC7mtj7gDNqTBzPUdosux1R26Cyp7qA7WHkNA/edit#gid=758659753
During the 27 Nov call we assigned a lead for the work on each of these properties. We will discuss the progress in the call on January 15.
- author instructions for AGU journals (Shelley), ready for final feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dT7JAHMhty2JC_T0OF5bxkMvUk46rb9Af9rrjHPV1Ks/edit?usp=sharing. Shelley will send email to Working Group mailing list
