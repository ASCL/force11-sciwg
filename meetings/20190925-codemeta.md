### Attending

### Actions

## Agenda

* define scope for task force. Proposal: fully align codemeta with schema.org metadata schema.
* if we align codemeta with schema.org, what does that mean for codemeta documentation, Crosswalk table, use of other schema.org properties, etc. Come up with proposal for Force11 Software Citation Implementation WG
* do work at Force2019 hackathon on October 15?
* logistics: task force co-chairs, schedule for upcoming calls

## Notes

This is the second call of the Force11 Software Citation Implementation WG Codemeta Task Force, after a hiatus of 12 months ([call notes 20 August 2018](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/blob/master/meetings/2018-08-20-codemeta.md)). The task force will specifically work on aligning with the [Codemeta Project](https://codemeta.github.io/). We decided that a monthly call for the next 6-12 months would be appropriate.
