#### General logistics

- Task forces will be suggested using GitHub issues. Before initiation, those involved in the task force should identify: who's involved, a timeline, what will be delivered/achieved.
- Monthly call used to keep task forces coordinated with each other, as well as reporting to the community
- Aim to scope out initial goals for each task force

People to indicate their interest in participating by commenting on the relevent GitHub issue.

Named people to put out a call for participation to the mailing list and schedule a first call. After first call, identify task force leaders going forward and draft goals and milestones.
