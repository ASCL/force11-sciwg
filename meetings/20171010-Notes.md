### 1) Feedback on the revised DataCite Metadata Schema for Software

Next update of Datacite Metadata schema (v4.1) is coming out soon with better support for software.

Slightly awkward timing for this call: too late for major changes but too early to be able to solicit comments on a public draft.

Public draft expected to be available before FORCE2017. We will collect feedback on the draft via GitHub issues in the 
FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group GitHub repository (one per topic) by the end of November. 
Martin Fenner will summarise these and feed back to the DataCite Metadata committee.

The revised schema is alread in the DataCite test system: https://schema.test.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.1/

Zenodo will be testing an implementation of the revised schema.
Elsevier are interested in evaluating schema once published.

Questions:

Morane - when will there be a mapping with [CodeMeta](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta)?
90% done because not much changed - could do this at the hackathon.

Ilian - will DataCite be providing specific example for software citation? Yes, this will 

Helge - How are fields in datacite schema filled?
swMath approach is extracting information from existing publications.
If you would like to have a look at our working prototype that we are going to present at FORCE11, here is an example for the software SINGULAR: http://tempas.l3s.de/micrawler/permalink/21ac3d3
the idea is to collect and archive all resource on the web that are available about a software make this citable

Morane - Software Heritage use CodeMeta crosswalk table to map from other schema used by different sites to DataCite schema

Stephan - created a minimal, extensible format for software citations for the case where you are "manually" creating a citation for their software. See: http://sdruskat.net/citation-file-format/

Lars - CodeMeta useful to generate CITATION files from GitHub metadata, puts it in a sensible place


### 2) Noting of relevant events and sessions at FORCE2017

swMath - software citation landing pages session. Most citations limited to name or publication, not the software itself. Built landing pages from data in publications containing information about the content.

Friday, 27 Oct 2017, 09:00–10:00, Room 5

Stephan Janosch is presenting results on survey of what people are doing in Germany

Wed, 25 Oct 2017, 12:10–13:00, Room 4

Hackathon is on Thursday in the Atelier Room. Starts with a one hour session introducing the work of the working groups (including this group). Have the rest of the day to work on different topics. Hackathon is more generally on citation.


### 3) Discussion and generation of ideas for FORCE2017 Citation Hackathon – Martin Fenner and Neil Chue Hong to lead

Hack ideas can be contributed by logging an issue here: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues and labelling it with "FORCE2017 Hack". A list of all current hackathon ideas is here: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22FORCE2017+Hack%22

Neil will circulate remote participation instructions week before.

Hack ideas:
- virtualisation - build docker containers where you can share whole package. Beyond citation is accessibility.
- CodeMeta - checking it works with DataCite, new crosswalks
- showing how you can use CodeMeta in different situations
- tooling to make it easier to generate and using citations
- JSON based tools. 
- Martin would like to turn metadata for DOIs to JATS XML.

Ilian - I'm interested in creating software metadata to advance interoperability between software tools in materials modelling - https://emmc.info/emmc-workshop-on-interoperability-in-materials-modelling/

Melissa - This is linked to that idea: https://elifesciences.org/labs/7dbeb390/reproducible-document-stack-supporting-the-next-generation-research-article

Jeff - Something like [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) without the current lock-in: [reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/) and reprozip server out of NYU.


### 4) Discussion of regular timeslot for monthly group calls

Most on call felt this time or one hour later worked. Neil will solicit further feedback via the mailing list.
