How does review fit into the citation process?


Is there someone to discuss where other objects can be cited in a way / attribution that's not tied to existing publication system?
- FORCE11 Scholarly Commons group?
- Software dependency discussions
- Probably not SCI, but maybe another group in FORCE11

Citing for reproducibility? So do this in methodology?
- information from citation is not enough to do full reproducibility
- identification is a step needed, but more is required beyond this
