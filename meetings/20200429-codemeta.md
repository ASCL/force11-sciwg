## Notes
* Here thereâ€™s a description on how schema.org workflow work: https://schema.org/docs/howwework.html

* *issueTracker* - change definition to issue tracking instance?
The curent definition:
> link to software bug reporting or issue tracking system

* *embargoDate* - generic property
ACTION: propose change of property to *embargoEndDate* or *availableDate* or *dateAvailable* in CodeMeta

* *referencePublication* -
ACTION: change property description in CodeMeta to empasise it is the main publication describing the software
The current definition:
> An academic publication related to the software.

* *readme* - we discused the utility of this property and if we should keep it

* *hasSourceCode* - this is a  new proposed property to add to CodeMeta v3, which is still pending.
We decided to wait for its acceptance before proceeding in schema.org alignment.
