## Notes
* We have reviewed the following terms and their status:
  1. *softwareSuggestions* - 
  https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues/233
  We discussed the ambiguity of the current term and the proposal to modify the property to `optionalDependencies`
  
  2. *maintainer* - 
  Pending proposal on schema.org https://schema.org/maintainer
  maybe we should add maintainer to SSC as well (seems this is only for Software Application- suggestion to add a comment to SSC class)
  
  ACTION: Morane to comment issue in schema.org (https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2311)
  
  3. *continuousIntegration* - 
  suggest to expand the label to ‘continuousIntegration’, agreed by Telecon participants

  4. *buildInstructions* - 
  We discussed what is the target of this term, a specific case in R (also in the crosswalk table it is rarely use)
  A more generic term would be `user manual`, `documentation`
  There is an existing property http://schema.org/installUrl
  
  5. *developmentStatus* - 
  Pending proposal on schema.org https://schema.org/creativeWorkStatus
  
  ACTION: Morane to ask Catherine (Property lead) about commenting this thread https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/987
