## Citation Formats (BiBTeX, CSL, CFF etc) and can we fix the BiBTeX misc issue?
Stephan Druskat introduces [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) (and [blog post](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-12-12-standard-format-citation-files)). There is a crosswalk table for CFF in codemeta, but exact relationship to codemeta is unclear. Stephan will look into this.
