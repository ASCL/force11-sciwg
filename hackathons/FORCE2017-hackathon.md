# FORCE2017 Hackathon / Do-a-thon

This is a hackathon related to citation at the FORCE2017 conference.

Most of the ideas for the software citation side will be around implementing different aspects of the software citation workflow:
- Generating a citation from a source code repository, or repo URL
- Taking a CodeMeta.json file and turning it into a CSL file / BiBTeX etc
- Understanding where citations should appear, and how to get publisher support for them
- Understand the usage of citations: how much is already cited, where is it from?
