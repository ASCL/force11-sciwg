## Background

This document provides a simple, generic checklist that authors of academic work (papers, books, conference abstracts, blog posts, etc.) can use to ensure they are following good practice when referencing and citing software they have used, both created by themselves for their research as well as obtained from other sources.

It may also be used and adapted by journal editors, publishers and conference chairs as the basis of more specific guidance for their contributors and reviewers.

## Checklist for citing software

* Have I identified the software, including my own, which makes a significant and specialised contribution to my academic work, and therefore should be cited?
* Have I checked if the software has a recommended citation from the creators and used it if available? If this is to a paper, have I also cited the software directly? 
* Have I created as complete a citation as possible if no recommended citation is given? Does it include who created the software, when it was created, the title of the software (and version if available) and where the software can be accessed (preferably via a persistent identifier to an archival repository)?
* Have I referenced the software appropriately in my academic work, in compliance with any citation formatting guidelines?
