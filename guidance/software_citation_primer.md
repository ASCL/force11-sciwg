# Why is it so important to cite software?

Books and journal articles have long benefited from an infrastructure that makes them easy to cite, a key element in the process of research and academic discourse. We believe that you should cite software (including code, scripts, notebooks and libraries) in just the same way that you cite other sources of information, such as articles and books.

Citing software helps further research and improves access to research software in order to:

  - support proper attribution and credit
  - support collaboration and reuse
  - enable reproducibility of findings
  - [DSK: this seems to duplicate the statement above the bullets] foster faster and more efficient research progress, and
  - provide the means to share software and data with future researchers

FORCE11 has been developing guidance to support [DSK: implement?] software citation. The Software Citation Principles (Smith et al. 2016) were written to encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. The Software Citation Checklist for Authors (Chue Hong et al. 2019a) and Software Citation Checklist for Developers (Chue Hong et al. 2019b) provide more practical information for those seeking to improve their practice.

## Software Citation Essentials

We recognise that the challenges associated with software deposit and publication vary across disciplines, and we encourage research communities to develop citation systems that work well for them. We also recognise that the citation style formats used vary between disciplines and journals.

Our recommendation for software citation is to ensure the following information is provided as part of the reference:

  - Creator: the authors or project that developed the software
  - Title: the name of the software
  - Identifier: a [DSK: persistent?] resolvable pointer to the software [DSK: or to a landing page?]

It may also be desirable to include information about three optional properties (as appropriate):

  - Date: the date the software was created or published.
  - Version: the identifier for the version of the software being referenced.
  - Publisher: the repository publishing the software.
